# Greeting Card

## Introduction
- This project is my first Android app - 
- Building this very simple text app was part of my learning in Makers Module 3 - Mobile Applications: Android applications.
- It follows the offical [Android documentation tutorial](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app#7)
